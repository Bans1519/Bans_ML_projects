Titanic Survival Prediction

Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The Titanic dataset, available on Kaggle, provides various features such as passenger demographics, ticket information, and survival status. The goal is to develop an effective model that can accurately classify whether a passenger survived the tragic sinking.

Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
Name: Name of the passenger.
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age in years.
SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard.
Parch: Number of parents or children aboard.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Ticket fare.
Cabin: Cabin number (if applicable).
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).
Survived: Survival status (0 = No; 1 = Yes).

Methodology
1.Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
-Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
-Handle missing values and outliers.
-Encode categorical variables.

2.Feature Engineering:
-Create new features that could improve model performance (e.g., family size).
-Normalize or standardize numerical features as necessary.

3.Model Selection:
-Implement several classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines).
-Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

4.Model Evaluation:
-Analyze model accuracy using metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy score, precision, and recall.
-Tune hyperparameters to enhance model performance.

5.Submission:
-Prepare a submission file formatted according to Kaggle's requirements.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
